## Executive Summary
This project solves a strategic pricing problem: discount practices are increasing volume but leaking significant net revenue.

Audience: Revenue leaders, category managers, and operations teams who need to maximize commercial performance without adding acquisition cost.

North Star Metric: **Net Revenue Retained (NRR)** = `total_revenue / gross_revenue`.

From the current dataset baseline:
- Net revenue: **$32.87M**
- Discount leakage: **$5.05M**
- NRR: **86.69%**
- 5% leakage recovery upside: **$252.3K**

## Problem
How can we reduce discount leakage while preserving sales velocity?

## Approach
- Build a reproducible end-to-end pipeline.
- Enforce data quality constraints.
- Engineer business-ready features.
- Rank category-level leakage opportunities.
- Deliver executive dashboard views for action.

## Key Insights
- Leakage is materially relevant versus current net revenue.
- Opportunity concentration exists by category.
- A small recovery rate already creates meaningful upside.

## Expected Impact
Recovering 5% of current discount leakage can add about **$252K** in net revenue.

## Methodology
Ingestion -> Cleaning -> Feature Engineering -> Evaluation -> Visualization

## Dataset Source
- Kaggle dataset: `aliiihussain/amazon-sales-dataset`
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliiihussain/amazon-sales-dataset

## Architecture
See root `README.md` for complete project tree and runbook.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Docker
```bash
docker build -t amazon-sales-analytics .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 amazon-sales-analytics
```

## Quality and Contracts
- Raw contract: `contracts/sales_dataset.contract.json`
- Product metrics contract: `contracts/product_metrics.contract.json`
- Pipeline gates:
  - raw schema contract enforcement
  - clean-data quality checks
  - metrics generation in `reports/metrics/product_metrics.json`

### Local Quality Commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
black --check .
isort --check-only .
ruff check .
mypy src scripts
pytest
```

## CI and Product Metrics
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Gates: format, lint, typing, tests, coverage (`>=70%`)
- Exported CI artifacts:
  - `reports/metrics/coverage.xml`
  - `reports/metrics/pytest-results.xml`

## Release Process
1. Add release entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Bump version:
   ```bash
   python scripts/bump_version.py 0.2.0
   ```
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```
4. Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) validates tag/version/changelog consistency.
