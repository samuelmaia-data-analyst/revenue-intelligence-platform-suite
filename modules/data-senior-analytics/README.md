Business-focused analytics project that turns raw tabular files into decision-ready insights with a reproducible pipeline and interactive dashboard.

Live demo: https://data-analytics-sr.streamlit.app

## Executive Summary
- Problem: teams depend on slow spreadsheet workflows and non-standard analysis quality.
- Approach: layered pipeline (`raw -> bronze -> silver -> gold`) with ingestion, transformation, EDA, and dashboard delivery.
- Results: CI-gated analytics repo with data governance, output contracts, and reproducible execution.

## Impact
- Metrics: CI automation enforces lint + format + tests + coverage (`>=70%`) on every PR.
- Assumptions: input is CSV/XLSX from business users, with mixed quality and partial missing values.
- Outcomes: faster insight turnaround with stable output schema for dashboard and stakeholder consumption.
